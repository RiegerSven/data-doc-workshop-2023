# Data processing

**Steps** in data processing (or preparation) include:

1.  [Recoding variables]    
2.  [Auto-recoding]   
3.  [Building new variables]


## Recoding variables

When recoding variables, new values are assigned to the old values (e.g. reversed polarity items).

The old values can either be overwritten by the new values **or saved as a new variable**.

## We always create a new variable when recoding!

-   old values are not lost    
-   errors during recoding can be reproduced

:::

**Procedure:**

1.  Transform    
2.  Recode in new variable
